For example, if the floor surface is a single color, it will take longer to be detected by the camera sensors than a floor with a flower print. The more detailed the floor is, the faster it can be detected by the camera sensors.</indent>\n2. <indent=10>The app includes tasks and interactions that are done and controlled with touch or user movement.</indent>\n3. <indent=10>For a proper representation of the virtual scene, a space of at least 2.5m x 2.5m is needed. It is also possible to reposition the jibarm if there is a better position for the view or task.</indent>"
