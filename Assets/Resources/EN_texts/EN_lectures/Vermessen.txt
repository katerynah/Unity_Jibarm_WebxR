M1 then corresponds with the marker '01'. Open the <b>'Ray Locator'</b> window on the touch screen and press <b>M1</b> on the screen. Then navigate to the <b>'GRAB'</b> submenu and decide whether to grab it (i.e. use the pan and tilt values for this position to calculate). When the colour changes to green, the measurement of that point is done. Take the laser, point to the correct position and then press 'GRAB' again. \n\nThe head and the cable should be turned to a position where the laser does not hit any obstacles. \n\nOnly the encoder values of the arm are used for the measurement. The <b>laser must be exactly in the centre of the marker</b>. The more mistakes you make, the less accurate the overall result will be. At this point it is important to pay attention not only to the laser but also to the arm so that the cable remains without being entangled. Every time the arm is moved, the position of the cable must also be taken into account. It may be necessary to rotate the jib arm so that the cable is loose again.\n\nIt is helpful to turn the brakes in a little so that the arm does not turn so quickly. \n\nAlso pay attention to the cable on the dolly. It is best to turn it out completely once when the jib arm measures the markers on the left side. 18 markers should be enough.\n\nAfter measuring at least 18 markers, the laser is closed and the values are saved on the screen with <b>'SAVE GRABS'</b>. <b>'LOCATE'</b> evaluates the measured values and shows whether the measurement was correct. The result should be evaluated as <b>'GOOD'</b>.\n\nIn the picture the standard deviation is 0.002 = 2mm for X and 8mm for Y.\n The angle for the home position is also shown. When the boom pan sweeps above zero (at the arrow marker), this angle is 77 degrees with respect to the home point. It also corresponds approximately with the rotation of the trolley. \n\nBut depending on how the lower base is levelled, the trolley could also be at an angle. This is also calibrated and entered. Here it is about 0.48 degrees in the tilt axis and also 0.5 degrees around the optical axis (Z and XY axis). Then you can confirm with 'OK'. The system restarts and the changed position is communicated. \n\n<b>One should also mention in advance: It is important that the tracking is running, because this provides the measured pan and tilt data.</b>"
