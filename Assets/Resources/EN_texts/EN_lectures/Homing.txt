            "copytext":"\n<size=10><b>Homing</b></size>\n\nHoming refers to the <b>calibration of the position values</b> of the axes of the arm using encoders and a tracking interface in a virtual setup. This involves setting a reference point for the encoders to determine the absolute position of the axes..\n\nIn this setup, the <b>encoders</b> are <b>relative</b>, which means that they provide high resolution, but they do not provide information about the absolute position of the encoders. To determine this, the system sends an <b>'index signal'</b> at a specific point, and the boom or head must be moved to this point to establish the reference point. The tilt axis of the arm has <b>two triangles</b> that mark the reference point, and the pan axis can be homed by moving from left to right. The tracking interface has several inputs, including a serial port that is used to retrieve the absolute position values of the lens data.\n\nIt is important to note that there are <b>no predetermined directions or sequences</b> for homing the axes. The arm can be homed with a single movement and the system is ready for use as soon as all axes are homed. The system is 75% operational before it is homed, but the relationship between the axes in the virtual setup will not be correct. To fully calibrate the system, the tilt and pan axes of the arm and the tilt and pan axes of the head must be homed. The <b>green LED on the box</b> indicates that the <b>tracking process has been started</b> and that tracking data is being sent, which can be helpful in diagnosing errors."
