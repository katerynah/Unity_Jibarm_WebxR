This should be done by first moving the dolly to the desired position and using the jacks to apply slight pressure to the floor.\n\n<b>Alternatively, wooden boards</b> could be placed under the jacks <b>to avoid rubber marks on the floor</b>. It is important to apply only light pressure with the jacks before levelling, as full mobility of the jack is desired later.\n\nOnce all the jacks are in contact with the ground, you can use a <b>spirit level</b> at the base of the dolly to make sure it is level. The easiest way to do this is to <b>adjust the arms in both directions to see how the spirit level is aligned</b>. Then the jacks can be used to align the dolly horizontally and vertically. When working with a partner, one person can hold the spirit level and the other adjust the jacks."
