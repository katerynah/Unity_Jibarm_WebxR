It is used both as a studio coordinate system and as a camera coordinate system and can be freely chosen.\n\nThe <b>origin</b> of the coordinate system is marked with a small pencil. When standing at this point, the positive X-axis is to the right of the marked point.\n\nThe <b>'right hand rule'</b> says that the Z-axis points upwards. Here the camera is 3 metres to the right (X-axis) of the marked point, 1 metre back (Y-axis) and 4.5 metres up (Z-axis).\n\nNote that the <b>coordinates are not given from the dolly, but from the camera head</b>. Only the main point of the optical system is interesting for the graph and not what is underneath it.\n\n\n<size=10><b>Landmarks</b></size>\n\nIn the studio there are several reference points called <b>landmarks</b>. For an accurate measurement it is important to have a good distribution not only in relation to the pan (pan in the horizontal) but also in the vertical. Therefore, there are not only points at the top (above the same tilt angle), but also a few points further down. <b>The origin can also be used as a landmark</b>. If you cannot see some points, for example because there is a lot of interference like chairs, people, etc., you can use the other landmarks. There is also a point under the carpet.\n\nYou can always measure more points. <b>If one is out of sight, this is not a problem because it is simply not used.</b> Normally these points are set by professional staff. It is not intended that students set them themselves.\n\n<b>The landmarks are set as follows: </b>\nStarting from the origin, the second auxiliary point (which sets the X-axis) is set at the edge. Then there are four more points distributed in the studio and these are measured among themselves. They define the studio coordinate system. From these points, the distance to each landmark is measured."
