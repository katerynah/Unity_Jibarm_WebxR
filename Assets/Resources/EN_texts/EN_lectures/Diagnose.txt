When driving with one axis, you should see that the VR jumps once and the orientation is correct when the index is reached . This can be done with all four axes in succession. When the VR has jumped  four times, all axes are correctly measured.\n\n<b>Touchscreen-Interface</b>: One goes to <b>“DIAG”</b> (diagnosis) and selects <b>'STOP ALL'</b> to interrupt the tracking process. Then the graphics computer is informed that it is no longer receiving tracking data. Afterwards, the function <b>'test encoders'</b> can be selected to check the encoder inputs. It is important not to click on <b>'reset encoders'</b> as this will delete all homing and index points collected so far. Selecting <b>'test encoders'</b> should display asterisks<b> next to the encoder inputs indicating that the index signal has been received. This is <b>purely a diagnostic function</b>. When all encoder inputs are correctly measured, go back to DIAG and select 'STOP ALL' to stop the tracking process..\n\nOn the tracking interface itself there is a window where you can see the encoder values, which are labelled accordingly (e.g. encoder input 1: boom pan, encoder input 2: boom tilt, etc.). Encoders that are not connected are not labelled. Furthermore, there are the absolute values for zoom and focus that come from the camera.\n\nThe camera parameters based on the configuration file generate the X, Y, Z coordinates of the camera based on the calibration, as well as the pan, tilt and roll data, the field of view and the distortion parameters. The log window can also display the encoder inputs and sync. It is important to note that an error message is displayed if there are problems with the sync. The Vinten Fluid head also has a multiple ratio encoder in the pan axis. It is <b>important not to over-rotate the pan rotation</b> as this will shift the zero point and potentially change the whole set. Therefore, avoid rotating the head once through 360°."
